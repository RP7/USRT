# USRT user space real time architecture
* Mixed physical and cpu timing reference
* User space coding with Cgroup
* Non-preemptive user defined schedule
* Multi-core and fully share memory
* Non-general but simple task(function) structure
* Self-evolution
* minimal hardware buffer
* Robust failure recover
